// In this project, the HTML file contains an audio element for playing the music, two buttons for playing and pausing the music, and a basic container for styling. The CSS file styles the layout and buttons, and the JavaScript file adds functionality to play and pause the music using the buttons.

// Replace "your-music-file.mp3" in the <source> tag with the path to your actual music file.

// This is a simple music player example, and you can further enhance it by adding features like a progress bar, volume control, playlist support, and more advanced styling.
